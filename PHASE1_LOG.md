# Phase 1 Log / Journal

## What We Accomplished
- Designed and built a modern markdown editor with live preview
- Integrated local LLM drafting via Ollama (API)
- Implemented a model selection dropdown for easy switching
- Provided clear status messages and error handling
- Used Marked.js for fast, reliable markdown rendering
- Established a clean, user-friendly UI/UX

## Key Decisions
- **Frontend only:** No backend required; runs locally in browser
- **Ollama for LLM:** Chosen for privacy, speed, and local control
- **Model dropdown:** Prevents typos and makes model selection easy
- **Status feedback:** Essential for user trust and debugging
- **Simple file structure:** index.html, style.css, script.js for easy onboarding

## Notable Challenges & Solutions
- **Model name typos:** Solved by switching to a dropdown
- **Ollama errors:** Added robust error handling and user guidance
- **Live preview performance:** Marked.js via CDN is fast and reliable

## Ready for Next Phase
- Foundation is solid for adding copy editing and brainstorming
- UI is clean and extensible
- Code is commented and documented
- Git repository can be initialized for version control

## 2024-06-07: Formatting Toolbar & Dark Mode
- Added a formatting toolbar above the markdown editor for quick insertion of bold, italic, heading, list, inline code, and code block markdown syntax
- Implemented a light/dark mode toggle with a sun/moon button in the top right
- Dark mode uses comfortable, high-contrast colors for a pleasant writing experience
- Theme preference is remembered using localStorage
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub for progress tracking

## Phase 2: Electron Desktop App - Initial Setup (2024-06-07)
- Converted web app to standalone desktop application using Electron
- Set up Node.js project structure
- Implemented basic Electron window management
- Maintained all Phase 1 features in desktop environment:
  - Markdown editor with live preview
  - LLM drafting via Ollama
  - Formatting toolbar
  - Dark/light mode toggle
- Added npm scripts for development and testing
- Prepared foundation for native desktop features:
  - File system integration
  - System tray
  - Auto-updates
  - Window state management

## Improved toolbar formatting logic: Bold and Italic buttons now trim leading/trailing spaces from selection, ensuring valid markdown even when double-clicking words (which selects trailing spaces). This makes formatting more intuitive and robust.
## Layout updated so LLM controls are always visible without scrolling; responsive design for different screen sizes.
## Theme toggle (light/dark) now works reliably and remembers user preference.

# Phase 1 Log / Journal

## What We Accomplished
- Designed and built a modern markdown editor with live preview
- Integrated local LLM drafting via Ollama (API)
- Implemented a model selection dropdown for easy switching
- Provided clear status messages and error handling
- Used Marked.js for fast, reliable markdown rendering
- Established a clean, user-friendly UI/UX

## Key Decisions
- **Frontend only:** No backend required; runs locally in browser
- **Ollama for LLM:** Chosen for privacy, speed, and local control
- **Model dropdown:** Prevents typos and makes model selection easy
- **Status feedback:** Essential for user trust and debugging
- **Simple file structure:** index.html, style.css, script.js for easy onboarding

## Notable Challenges & Solutions
- **Model name typos:** Solved by switching to a dropdown
- **Ollama errors:** Added robust error handling and user guidance
- **Live preview performance:** Marked.js via CDN is fast and reliable

## Ready for Next Phase
- Foundation is solid for adding copy editing and brainstorming
- UI is clean and extensible
- Code is commented and documented
- Git repository can be initialized for version control

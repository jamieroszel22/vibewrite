# Phase 3 Implementation Log: LLM-Powered Copy Editor

This log tracks the progress of implementing the LLM-Powered Copy Editor feature as outlined in `PHASE-3-COPY-EDITING-PLAN.md`.

## Iteration 1: Grammar Checking (via Paragraph Rewrite & Diff)

**Date Range:** 2024-03-19 - 2024-03-20

**Completed Steps:**

*   **F3.0: Basic UI for Copy Editing Trigger & Display**
    *   **F3.0.1:** Added "Analyze for Issues" button to `index.html`.
    *   **F3.0.2:** Created a dedicated "Analysis Suggestions" area in `index.html` to list suggestions.
*   **F3.0: IPC Communication Setup**
    *   **F3.0.3:** Defined `window.api.invokeCopyAnalysis` IPC channel in `preload.js`.
    *   **F3.0.4:** Created a basic handler for `invoke-copy-analysis` in `main.js` (initially mock, then replaced).
*   **F3.X (Adapted from F3.1 & F3.2): LLM Grammar Check (Paragraph by Paragraph, Suggestion List via Rewrite & Diff)**
    *   **F3.X.1 (Adapted F3.1.1 - Backend `main.js`): LLM Paragraph Rewriting & Change Detection**
        *   Implemented logic to split input text into paragraphs.
        *   For each paragraph, send it to Ollama (`gemma3:4b`) with a prompt instructing it to rewrite the paragraph with grammatical corrections.
        *   Successfully retrieved the corrected paragraph text from the LLM.
        *   Determined that `gemma3:4b` with a simplified rewriting prompt can correct basic grammatical errors (e.g., "he go too store." -> "He goes to the store.").
        *   Initial challenges with complex JSON output from LLM were overcome by simplifying the LLM's task to text rewriting.
    *   **F3.X.2 (Adapted F3.1.1 & F3.2.2 - Backend `main.js`): Suggestion Generation (Whole Paragraph Diff)**
        *   If the LLM-corrected paragraph differs from the original, a single suggestion object is created.
        *   `originalPhrase` is set to the entire original paragraph.
        *   `correctedPhrase` is set to the entire LLM-corrected paragraph.
        *   The `diff` library (`diffWordsWithSpace`) was experimented with but ultimately a simpler whole-paragraph comparison was adopted for the initial successful implementation.
    *   **F3.X.3 (Adapted F3.1.2 - Frontend `script.js`): Displaying Paragraph-Level Suggestions**
        *   `script.js` updated to receive the array of (single, paragraph-level) suggestions from `main.js`.
        *   Suggestions are displayed in the "Analysis Suggestions" list, showing the full original (struck-out) and full corrected paragraph text.
    *   **F3.X.4 (Adapted F3.2.1 & F3.2.2 - Frontend `script.js`): Applying Paragraph-Level Suggestions**
        *   Added an "Accept" button to each suggestion in the UI.
        *   Implemented logic so clicking "Accept" replaces the entire original paragraph in the editor with the LLM's corrected version.
        *   Includes a safety check to ensure the paragraph hasn't changed since analysis.

## Iteration 2: Spell Checking Implementation

**Date Range:** 2024-03-20

**Completed Steps:**

*   **F3.3: Spell Check Implementation**
    *   **F3.3.1: Local Spell Checker Setup**
        *   Created a pure JavaScript spell checker implementation using a dictionary of common words.
        *   Implemented Levenshtein distance algorithm for generating word suggestions.
        *   Added a mapping of common misspellings for improved suggestion accuracy.
    *   **F3.3.2: UI Integration**
        *   Added spell check button to the toolbar.
        *   Created a suggestions panel for displaying misspelled words and their corrections.
        *   Implemented "Accept" functionality for applying corrections.
    *   **F3.3.3: Security Improvements**
        *   Moved dependencies from CDN to local `lib` directory.
        *   Updated Content Security Policy to be more restrictive.
        *   Implemented proper error handling for spell checker initialization.

**Key Outcomes & Learnings:**
*   The initial strategy of asking the LLM for detailed, structured JSON output of errors was challenging for the `gemma3:4b` model.
*   Simplifying the LLM's task to rewriting the paragraph and then using JavaScript to detect changes (currently at a whole-paragraph level) proved much more effective and robust for an initial implementation.
*   The end-to-end flow for grammar analysis, suggestion display, and acceptance is now functional for whole-paragraph corrections.
*   Local spell checking implementation provides a reliable fallback when LLM-based checking is not available.
*   Security improvements through local dependencies and strict CSP enhance the application's security posture.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement word-level diffing for more granular grammar suggestions.
2. Add support for custom dictionaries in spell checking.
3. Enhance the suggestions UI with inline highlighting.
4. Implement conciseness checking as outlined in the plan.
5. Add support for style suggestions (passive voice, clich√©s, etc.).

## Iteration 3: Refinement & Simplification (Paragraph Rewrite + Inline Diff)

**Date Range:** 2024-03-21

**Completed Steps:**

*   **Refined Grammar Suggestion Strategy:**
    *   Identified limitations with applying granular (word/phrase-level) suggestions due to cascading invalidation issues.
    *   Reverted to a paragraph-level analysis approach, but enhanced the display.
    *   **Backend (`main.js`):** Modified to generate one suggestion per paragraph. Each suggestion now includes the full original paragraph, the full corrected paragraph, and a `changes` array produced by `diff.diffWordsWithSpace`.
    *   **Frontend (`script.js`):**
        *   Updated suggestion display logic to process the `changes` array and render an inline diff view using `<ins>`/`<del>` tags (or styled spans) within the suggestion panel.
        *   Simplified the "Apply Suggestion" logic to replace the entire original paragraph with the full corrected paragraph retrieved from the suggestion object.
        *   Implemented a safer method for retrieving the corrected paragraph text (using suggestion ID lookup instead of storing text in data attributes).
    *   **UI (`index.html`):** Added CSS styles for the inline diff view (added/removed text).
*   **Removed Standalone Spell Check Feature:**
    *   Removed the "Spelling" tab and associated client-side spell checking logic (`dictionary`, `levenshteinDistance`, `findSuggestions`, `checkSpelling` functions in `script.js`).
    *   Rationale: LLM grammar check handles common spelling errors; removal simplifies UI and reduces code complexity.
*   **Simplified UI:**
    *   Removed the redundant "Grammar" tab button as only one analysis type remains.

**Key Outcomes & Learnings:**
*   Applying granular automated edits sequentially is problematic due to context shifts.
*   Paragraph-level atomic updates avoid cascading invalidation issues.
*   Displaying inline diffs provides the necessary contextual detail for paragraph-level suggestions.
*   Storing large text directly in HTML data attributes is unreliable; retrieving data from a stored JS object is safer.
*   LLM grammar checks often suffice for basic spelling correction, allowing for UI simplification.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Consider implementing conciseness checking (F3.4 & F3.5 from the plan).
2.  Consider implementing other analysis types (Readability F3.X, Style F3.Y).
3.  Explore advanced UI/UX like in-editor highlighting (F3.Z).

## Iteration 4: Unified Improvement Analysis

**Date Range:** 2024-03-22

**Completed Steps:**

*   **F3.4 & F3.5: Integrated Conciseness into Grammar Analysis**
    *   **F3.4.1 (Backend `main.js`): Enhanced LLM Prompt**
        *   Modified the grammar analysis prompt to include conciseness and clarity improvements
        *   Added specific criteria for improvements:
            - Grammar errors (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency)
            - Wordiness and redundancy
            - Clarity issues (unclear references, awkward phrasing)
        *   Improved response validation and error handling
    *   **F3.4.2 (Frontend `script.js`): Enhanced UI & Interaction**
        *   Updated suggestion display to handle combined improvements
        *   Added validation of suggestion data
        *   Improved error handling and user feedback
        *   Added visual feedback during suggestion application
        *   Prevented concurrent suggestion applications
    *   **F3.5.1 (Frontend `script.js`): Robust Suggestion Application**
        *   Added proper async/await handling
        *   Improved error handling with try/catch
        *   Added button state management during processing
        *   Enhanced error messages and UI feedback

**Key Outcomes & Learnings:**
*   Combining grammar and conciseness analysis into a single improvement flow simplifies the user experience
*   More specific LLM prompts lead to better and more consistent improvements
*   Proper error handling and user feedback are crucial for a good user experience
*   Preventing concurrent operations helps avoid race conditions
*   Data validation at multiple levels improves reliability

**Next Steps:**
1.  Consider implementing readability analysis (F3.X from the plan)
2.  Consider implementing style suggestions (F3.Y from the plan)
3.  Explore advanced UI/UX like in-editor highlighting (F3.Z)

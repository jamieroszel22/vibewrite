# Phase 3 Implementation Log: LLM-Powered Copy Editor

This log tracks the progress of implementing the LLM-Powered Copy Editor feature as outlined in `PHASE-3-COPY-EDITING-PLAN.md`.

## Iteration 1: Grammar Checking (via Paragraph Rewrite & Diff)

**Date Range:** [Insert Start Date] - [Insert Today's Date]

**Completed Steps:**

*   **F3.0: Basic UI for Copy Editing Trigger & Display**
    *   **F3.0.1:** Added "Analyze for Issues" button to `index.html`.
    *   **F3.0.2:** Created a dedicated "Analysis Suggestions" area in `index.html` to list suggestions.
*   **F3.0: IPC Communication Setup**
    *   **F3.0.3:** Defined `window.api.invokeCopyAnalysis` IPC channel in `preload.js`.
    *   **F3.0.4:** Created a basic handler for `invoke-copy-analysis` in `main.js` (initially mock, then replaced).
*   **F3.X (Adapted from F3.1 & F3.2): LLM Grammar Check (Paragraph by Paragraph, Suggestion List via Rewrite & Diff)**
    *   **F3.X.1 (Adapted F3.1.1 - Backend `main.js`): LLM Paragraph Rewriting & Change Detection**
        *   Implemented logic to split input text into paragraphs.
        *   For each paragraph, send it to Ollama (`gemma3:4b`) with a prompt instructing it to rewrite the paragraph with grammatical corrections.
        *   Successfully retrieved the corrected paragraph text from the LLM.
        *   Determined that `gemma3:4b` with a simplified rewriting prompt can correct basic grammatical errors (e.g., "he go too store." -> "He goes to the store.").
        *   Initial challenges with complex JSON output from LLM were overcome by simplifying the LLM's task to text rewriting.
    *   **F3.X.2 (Adapted F3.1.1 & F3.2.2 - Backend `main.js`): Suggestion Generation (Whole Paragraph Diff)**
        *   If the LLM-corrected paragraph differs from the original, a single suggestion object is created.
        *   `originalPhrase` is set to the entire original paragraph.
        *   `correctedPhrase` is set to the entire LLM-corrected paragraph.
        *   The `diff` library (`diffWordsWithSpace`) was experimented with but ultimately a simpler whole-paragraph comparison was adopted for the initial successful implementation.
    *   **F3.X.3 (Adapted F3.1.2 - Frontend `script.js`): Displaying Paragraph-Level Suggestions**
        *   `script.js` updated to receive the array of (single, paragraph-level) suggestions from `main.js`.
        *   Suggestions are displayed in the "Analysis Suggestions" list, showing the full original (struck-out) and full corrected paragraph text.
    *   **F3.X.4 (Adapted F3.2.1 & F3.2.2 - Frontend `script.js`): Applying Paragraph-Level Suggestions**
        *   Added an "Accept" button to each suggestion in the UI.
        *   Implemented logic so clicking "Accept" replaces the entire original paragraph in the editor with the LLM's corrected version.
        *   Includes a safety check to ensure the paragraph hasn't changed since analysis.

**Key Outcomes & Learnings:**
*   The initial strategy of asking the LLM for detailed, structured JSON output of errors was challenging for the `gemma3:4b` model.
*   Simplifying the LLM's task to rewriting the paragraph and then using JavaScript to detect changes (currently at a whole-paragraph level) proved much more effective and robust for an initial implementation.
*   The end-to-end flow for grammar analysis, suggestion display, and acceptance is now functional for whole-paragraph corrections.
